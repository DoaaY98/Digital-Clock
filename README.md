# Digital-Clock
Embedded System Project that is a digital clock using AVR microcontroller ATmega16 and C programming and Proteus simulation 

This project has been implemented Using ATmega16 mircocontroller.
It is written in C language using Eclipse IDE
it is simulated using proteus Simulation 


  This is a digital clock that counts the hours of the day (until 23:59:59)...
  
  there are three buttons that has been implemented using External Interrupts:
  1- RESET - resets the clock to zero
  2- PAUSE - pauses the clock at the time it has reached
  3 -RESUME - resumes the clock 
  
  the clock counts using the TIMER module and it displays the digits on a 8-LED chip.
